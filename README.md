- Bootstrap

### Back-end
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite3

### Cloud Services
- Azure Resource Groups --Azure Resource Groups are logical containers that allow you to manage and organize related Azure resources. These resources can include virtual machines, databases, web apps, storage accounts, and more.
  
- Azure Virtual Networks -- Azure Virtual Networks (VNet) allow you to create isolated networks in the Azure cloud, similar to traditional on-premises networks. VNets provide segmentation, isolation, and control over network traffic within Azure.

- Azure virtual nwtworks intergration --Azure Virtual Network Integration allows Azure resources, such as Azure Web Apps or Azure Functions, to access resources within a VNet. This integration provides secure and private connectivity between the Azure service and the resources within the VNet.
  
- Azure Web App - Azure Web App is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that allows you to build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs quickly and easily.
- 
- Monitoring -Azure Monitoring is a comprehensive solution for monitoring the performance, availability, and health of Azure resources and applications in real-time.

### AI Integration
- Ai language
- AI BoT Servies
